### React Day Picker Input Fields

Fix input field within the calendar
[docs](https://daypicker.dev/guides/input-fields)

### Broken employee and service search

It should use names for values inside of the fields, but somehow provide the ID to the form for submition.

### Convenient and obvious selection of employee and service

Employees should have avatars next to their names. Services should be colored based on type.

Only available services for the selected employee and vice verca should be selectable. All non selectable elements should have lower opacity.

### Rework pickers

Make your own component for selecting services/employees
