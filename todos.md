[docs](https://daypicker.dev/guides/input-fields)

### Convenient and obvious selection of employee and service

Employees should have avatars next to their names. Services should be colored based on type.

Only available services for the selected employee and vice verca should be selectable. All non selectable elements should have lower opacity.

### Rework pickers

Make your own component for selecting services/employees

### Add service icons with fallback to employee picker

Add fallback

### Add i18n

### Add form errors above submit button so mobile users can see they haven't filled it out properly

### Add admin page

### Restyle the appointment booking page, so that there's a container with min-w-screen and padding, and all of the items are inside of it
