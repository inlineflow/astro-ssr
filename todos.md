Fix input field within the calendar
[docs](https://daypicker.dev/guides/input-fields)

### Rework pickers

Make your own component for selecting services/employees

### Add admin page

### Restyle pickers so they look good

### Use the Avatar component for the Employee Avatar in employee picker. Use suspense, and TanStack Query if you need to.

### Consider using Js Date.toISOString instead of parsing to Luxon DateTime and then DateTime.toISOString

### Consider moving the employee provider higher into the form

### Re-factor the form to load the skeleton instantly and load up employees and services after using TanStack Query and Suspense (research if TanStack Query is actually necessary)

# Rework timeblocks to accept the current service and re-render to show available blocks

# Expand Service type to show how long the procedure takes and show the cost

# Localize calendar to KG

# Add localization to KG

# Make the establishments view on larger screens a grid of items

# Add search to establishments view (should call the backend)

# Consider if using Suspense in the Form is a good idea

# Make the language picker look good
